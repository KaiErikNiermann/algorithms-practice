### Notes
My focus here was to have a collection of algorithms written in different langauges as a means to understand the algorithms while at the same time praciticing programming languages. Additionally I wanted to focus on simplicity and clarity of each implementation.

Some algorithms have different versions, usually earlier versions are less clean but sometimes easier to understand implementations.

I will likely add to this collection over time. If there are any errors please do say so and I will try my best to correct them.
